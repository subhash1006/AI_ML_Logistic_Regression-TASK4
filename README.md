# Logistic Regression â€“ Breast Cancer Classification

This project demonstrates the use of *Logistic Regression* to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a breast tumor is *malignant* or *benign* based on diagnostic features.

## Dataset
- *Samples*: 569
- *Features*: 30 numeric features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness)
- *Target*:
  - 1: Malignant
  - 0: Benign

---

## Objectives

- Train a Logistic Regression model on a real-world medical dataset
- Evaluate performance using multiple metrics
- Demonstrate threshold tuning and sigmoid probability interpretation

## Technologies Used

- *Python 3*
- *Jupyter Notebook*
- *Pandas, NumPy* for data handling
- *scikit-learn* for ML modeling
- *Matplotlib, Seaborn* for visualization

## Result

- *Model Accuracy*: ~95%
- *ROC-AUC Score*: High performance in distinguishing malignant vs benign tumors
- *Interpretability*: Model outputs clear probabilities and decision boundaries
